MCP Server Authentication System – Technical Analysis

Embedding the MCP SDK in Existing Admin Panels
	•	Seamless Frontend Integration: The MCP client SDK is integrated directly into the admin panel’s frontend (e.g. via a script include or component). This means the chat assistant UI lives inside the already protected admin interface, rather than a separate standalone app ￼. It appears as an embedded chat bubble or panel within the admin UI, inheriting the existing login context of the administrator user.
	•	No Separate Login for Chat: Because the SDK runs in the context of the logged-in admin panel, it does not prompt for additional credentials. It relies on the fact that the user has already authenticated to the admin system. The chat widget is essentially a feature of the admin panel, so it trusts the panel’s session (there’s no separate “chat login” step).
	•	Frontend Implementation: The embed code initializes the chat assistant using the admin panel’s environment. For example, developers simply copy-paste an embed snippet or import the MCP SDK in the admin panel’s codebase ￼. This attaches the chat UI to the page (for instance, a floating chat icon). Because it’s running on the same page as the admin panel, it automatically has access to the session cookies or context of that page’s user session.
	•	Controlled Availability: By embedding into the admin panel, the MCP SDK and chat assistant are only available to users who can access that panel. This leverages the existing access controls – if a user doesn’t have an admin session, they can’t even load the admin panel (and thus cannot load the MCP widget). This containment ensures that the chat assistant is only active for authenticated admin users and inherits their permissions by design.

Leveraging Active User Sessions for Protected API Calls
	•	Contextual API Access: The MCP server acts as a backend-for-frontend (BFF) for the chat assistant. It does not have its own user database; instead, it uses the admin user’s current session to access protected backend APIs on behalf of that user. In practice, when the chat needs to fetch or modify data (e.g. “fetch the latest order status”), the request from the chat UI to the MCP server carries the user’s session token. The MCP server then includes those same credentials when calling the internal admin API, so the API sees the call as coming from the logged-in user.
	•	Session Token Propagation: The mechanism works like this: once a user logs into the admin panel, the main application issues a session token (for example, a session cookie or JWT cookie) to the browser. Every subsequent request from the UI (including MCP chat requests) automatically includes this session token ￼. The MCP server expects this token on each request and uses it to identify the user. In essence, the MCP server piggybacks on the existing session – if the user’s session is valid, requests go through; if not (e.g. expired or not present), the MCP server knows the user is not authenticated.
	•	No Credential Repetition: The system ensures it doesn’t ask for or handle user passwords or separate auth tokens. It strictly relies on the presence of the admin session. For example, if the admin panel uses a cookie-based session, the browser will send that cookie to the MCP server (provided the domain/CORS settings allow it). The MCP server then either trusts that cookie for authentication or forwards it to the actual protected API. This means the MCP server never needs to store or look up user credentials itself, it just leverages what’s already in place.
	•	On-Behalf-of Requests: When the MCP server calls internal APIs, it effectively does so “on behalf of” the user. Because the user’s token or session ID is included, the internal API can authorize the request as it would for the user. For instance, if the user’s role permits viewing certain data, the API will return it; if not, the API will deny it. The MCP server doesn’t have special privileges – it cannot access anything the user themselves couldn’t. This ensures authorization is consistently enforced by the existing backend using the user’s identity.

Transparent Credential Forwarding via Cookies
	•	Implicit Token Passing: All authentication tokens or session IDs are passed implicitly via HTTP headers (cookies) rather than explicit JavaScript code. The browser automatically includes the auth cookie in requests to the MCP server, so the front-end code doesn’t need to manually attach tokens (and indeed cannot, if using HttpOnly cookies). For example, if a JWT is stored in an HttpOnly cookie, that JWT is sent with each request to the MCP server without any JavaScript interaction ￼. The client logic simply makes a fetch/XHR call, and the browser’s cookie mechanism adds the session token in the request headers.
	•	HttpOnly Cookie Usage: In this model, authentication typically uses HttpOnly cookies (which can hold either a session ID or a JWT). HttpOnly cookies are not accessible to JavaScript, which means the MCP SDK cannot read or manipulate the token – it just triggers requests, and the cookie is attached by the browser automatically. This is a security advantage: even if the MCP SDK or any script is compromised, it can’t steal the token easily since document.cookie won’t reveal HttpOnly cookies ￼. The token remains opaque to the front-end; it’s just consistently included in requests.
	•	Session ID vs JWT in Cookie: Depending on the setup, the cookie might contain a session identifier (which the server uses to find session data) or a self-contained JWT. In either case, the browser handles sending it. If it’s a session ID, the MCP server will forward that cookie when calling other services or share it on a request so the main backend can resolve the session. If it’s a JWT, the MCP server can parse and verify it to get user info (more on that in supported modes). The key is that credentials ride along with requests by default, requiring no custom injection.
	•	No Credential in URL or Local Storage: This design avoids less secure patterns like putting tokens in localStorage or URLs. Tokens in localStorage could be read by malicious scripts; tokens in URLs could leak via logs. By relying on cookies and the browser’s inclusion of them in calls, the system ensures credentials are kept in their most secure, restricted container. The token never needs to appear in the JavaScript runtime or be manually copied around, reducing attack surface (e.g., resilient against XSS stealing the token from JS memory) ￼.

No Token Storage on the MCP Server (Stateless Auth Handling)
	•	Stateless Operation: The MCP server does not maintain any session state or token storage for users – it’s designed to be completely stateless regarding authentication. It doesn’t have a token database or cache; each request is authenticated on the fly using the token provided by the client. This means if there’s no token (or an invalid one), the request is simply rejected; if there is a token, it’s considered against the current user session. There is no “login” record on the MCP server to track or no token refresh timer to manage – it simply trusts the incoming context.
	•	Security and Simplification: Not storing tokens is a deliberate security measure. If the MCP server stored user tokens or session info, that would introduce additional risks and complexity. For one, it would have to protect that storage (encrypt it, prevent leaks, etc.), since those tokens are essentially keys to user data ￼. By not storing anything sensitive, we reduce the impact of a breach: there’s no stash of tokens to steal from the MCP server because none are kept. It also simplifies compliance – there’s no secondary session store to manage or audit.
	•	Avoiding Stale Credentials: Another benefit of not persisting tokens is that logout and expiry are handled uniformly. For example, if a user logs out of the admin panel (which clears their session cookie), the MCP server will naturally stop working for them (as it will no longer receive a valid session token). If the MCP server had cached a token, it might accidentally allow use after logout or hold an expired token. Stateless design means the MCP server always uses the latest token present in the user’s browser – if it’s gone or expired, the request fails, period. This avoids scenarios where a user’s token remains valid in one service after being revoked in another.
	•	No Long-Term Token Reuse: The MCP server doesn’t try to reuse or recycle tokens for future calls. If a new request comes in tomorrow, it expects the browser to send a fresh token again. This aligns with best practices that suggest it’s often “better to redo the authorization flow than to store tokens long-term” in ancillary services ￼. If a user’s session expires, the user simply needs to log in to the main system again, rather than the MCP server attempting to silently use an old stored token. This approach is simpler and less error-prone – the MCP server essentially says, “I’ll only act if you (the browser) present me a valid session at this moment.” It must not take on the role of token manager.

Supported Authentication Modes: JWT Cookies vs. Session Cookies
	•	JWT in HttpOnly Cookie: In one supported mode, the admin panel uses a JSON Web Token (JWT) for auth, stored in an HttpOnly cookie. In this case, the cookie’s value is the token (often a signed JWT with user identity and claims). The MCP server, upon receiving a request, can read this JWT from the cookie (server-side) and verify its signature and claims. Since the JWT is self-contained, it proves the user’s identity if valid. This is an example of a session token containing the session state (all the info needed is inside the token) ￼. The MCP server would typically verify the JWT’s signature (using the identity provider’s public key) and check that it’s not expired before proceeding. No further lookup is needed if the JWT is good – it directly tells who the user is and possibly what they’re allowed to do.
	•	Traditional Session ID Cookie: The other mode is a classic server-managed session, where the cookie holds a session identifier (like a random string or ID). In this scenario, the real session data (user ID, etc.) lives on the main authentication server or database. The MCP server may need to collaborate with the main auth system to validate this session ID. This could mean the MCP server simply forwards the cookie to the protected API (letting that API validate it), or the MCP server might have access to the session store to look up the user. This corresponds to a session token acting as an identifier that the server uses to retrieve state from a datastore ￼.
	•	Support Both Transparently: The MCP server is built to handle either method without storing anything itself. If the environment uses JWTs, the MCP server will treat the cookie as a bearer token – validate it and extract user info. If the environment uses server sessions, the MCP server will treat the cookie as a pointer – it might require an API call or internal lookup to authenticate, or simply pass it through to backend calls. From the frontend/MCP SDK perspective, nothing changes; it still just sends a cookie. The difference is entirely on the server side in how the token is interpreted.
	•	Trade-offs: Each mode has trade-offs, and the architecture supports both to remain flexible. JWT cookies are stateless and avoid database lookups (the trade-off is you must verify the token’s signature and deal with token expiry on each request). Session-ID cookies require the server to maintain state (the trade-off is very fine-grained control server-side and easy revocation by clearing the session). By supporting both, the MCP server can be used in setups where the admin panel is backed by an OAuth/OIDC JWT-based auth or by a traditional session-store auth. In either case, the cookie is HttpOnly and Secure as a rule, and the difference lies in whether the cookie’s content is meaningful by itself (JWT) or just an ID.

CORS Considerations and Domain Isolation
	•	Same-Origin vs Cross-Origin: Where the MCP server is hosted relative to the admin panel is crucial. For security, many setups deploy the MCP server on a separate subdomain or domain (to isolate it), which introduces cross-origin concerns. If the MCP server is on the same origin (same domain and port) as the admin panel, then browser requests to it are simple – cookies automatically go, no special configuration needed. However, it’s more common to run it on a separate domain or subdomain (e.g. admin.myapp.com for the panel and mcp.myapp.com for the chat server) to keep services modular. In that case, browsers treat requests to the MCP server as cross-site, because the host differs, even if the base domain is the same ￼. This triggers the Same-Origin Policy protections, meaning by default the browser would block the admin front-end from calling the MCP server.
	•	Enabling CORS for Subdomains: To allow the embedded chat frontend to talk to the MCP server on a different origin, the MCP server must explicitly enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for the admin panel’s origin. This typically involves setting HTTP response headers like Access-Control-Allow-Origin (explicitly listing the admin panel’s domain) and Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true on the MCP server responses ￼ ￼. Allowing credentials is key because we need cookies to be sent. For example, the MCP server might configure Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://admin.myapp.com and Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true so that the browser permits the cookie to travel with the request ￼ ￼. Without these, the browser would strip cookies or block the request entirely. It’s important that the allowed origin is specific (not * wildcard) when credentials are involved ￼, to prevent unwanted sites from invoking the MCP server.
	•	Cookie Domain Scope: In a subdomain scenario, the authentication cookie must be scoped in a way that it’s sent to the MCP server’s domain. Cookies have a Domain attribute that controls which hosts can receive them. If the admin panel sets its session cookie for admin.myapp.com (and does not allow subdomains), that cookie won’t be sent to mcp.myapp.com by default ￼. To share it, the cookie’s Domain should be set to the parent domain (e.g. .myapp.com), making it available to both the admin subdomain and the MCP subdomain ￼. This is typically done at login time by the auth system. Conversely, if security policy forbids a broad domain cookie (e.g. using the __Host- prefix which disallows any Domain attribute and locks the cookie to one host ￼), then the MCP server must reside on the same host as the admin panel to get the cookie – which is often not the case. Therefore, coordination on cookie domain is required: the authentication cookie should be set with a Domain that covers the MCP server’s host, or the MCP server can operate on a sub-path of the same domain.
	•	SameSite Attribute: Modern browsers also implement the SameSite cookie attribute which could block cookies in cross-site scenarios. If the admin panel and MCP server share the parent domain, they may be considered “same-site” by the browser (since the registrable domain is the same) and a Lax SameSite cookie might still be sent. However, to be safe (especially if the MCP server is on a completely different domain), the cookie might need SameSite=None; Secure to ensure it is sent along with cross-origin XHR/fetch requests ￼. Setting SameSite=None tells the browser to allow the cookie in cross-site requests (and requires Secure). This is important if, for example, the front-end at myadminpanel.com needs to call an MCP server at mycpservice.com – without SameSite=None, the browser would withhold the cookie, resulting in the MCP server seeing no session. That said, if using separate top-level domains in production, it’s generally discouraged due to increased complexity and security risk ￼. The best practice is to keep the MCP server under the same parent domain as the app, which avoids many of these issues and keeps the interaction “same-site” from the browser’s perspective ￼.
	•	Isolation Benefits: Running the MCP server on a distinct subdomain (or domain) can be beneficial for security (e.g., it could be served from a domain that has tighter CSP or separate cookies). It creates a boundary so that even if there’s a bug in the MCP server, it might not directly compromise the main application. But this isolation must be balanced with careful configuration so that the user’s session can be shared as intended. In summary, CORS headers and cookie attributes are configured such that the admin panel (origin) can talk to the MCP server (different origin) using the existing credentials. Only the trusted admin domain is permitted to invoke the MCP server, and the browser will send the session cookie only to that server when the request originates from the authorized domain ￼. This way, a malicious site can’t arbitrarily call the MCP server with the user’s cookie, because either the cookie won’t be sent (if the origin is wrong or CORS not allowed) or the request is blocked altogether.

Handling Authentication Failures (401/403 Errors)
	•	Expired or Missing Session (401 Unauthorized): If the user’s session is not present or no longer valid, the MCP server (or the downstream API it calls) will respond with an HTTP 401 Unauthorized status. A 401 indicates that authentication is required or failed – essentially, the server did not get a valid token to authorize the request ￼. In practice, this could happen if the user’s session cookie expired, or if the user manually logged out in another tab. The MCP server should handle this gracefully. For example, it might return a JSON error to the frontend indicating the user is not authenticated, which the frontend can use to prompt a re-login or refresh of the page. Importantly, the MCP server does not have its own login flow to fall back on; it must treat a 401 from the protected API as a signal to stop processing and propagate the unauthorized state. The admin panel might then show a message like “Your session has expired, please log in again,” possibly even automatically redirecting to the login page if the overall application does so on 401s.
	•	Insufficient Privileges (403 Forbidden): If the user is authenticated (valid session) but is asking the MCP assistant to perform an action they’re not allowed to, the downstream API will likely return HTTP 403 Forbidden. A 403 means the request was understood and the credentials were accepted, but the user doesn’t have permission to perform that operation ￼ ￼. The MCP server should handle this by not retrying or elevating privileges (it has none itself). Instead, it can relay a sanitized message back. For instance, if the AI assistant tried to access a resource the user isn’t allowed to see, the MCP server could catch the 403 and respond to the chat UI with an error like “Sorry, you don’t have access to that information.” This ensures the AI doesn’t inadvertently leak data; it simply reflects the authorization failure.
	•	Fallback Behaviors: In both cases (401 or 403), the MCP server must be careful not to masquerade or bypass the error. It should never attempt to use any master credentials to satisfy the request – that would violate the design. Instead, it fails transparently in the context of the user’s rights. Logging these events is also important: the MCP server should log when a request was rejected due to no auth or insufficient auth, which can help in troubleshooting (e.g., if cookies aren’t being sent properly, you’d see a lot of 401s). From the client side, encountering a 401/403 might disable the chat UI or prompt a refresh of the session. For example, the chat widget might display a notification like “🔒 Your session has ended. Please log in to continue using the assistant.” and refuse further queries until the user has re-authenticated in the main app.
	•	Consistency with Main App: The failure responses should ideally mirror the main application’s behavior for unauthorized requests. If the main admin API returns a specific error format or code for expired sessions, the MCP server can propagate that. This consistency helps the frontend handle it uniformly. In some cases, the MCP server could even trigger a redirect to the login (though since it’s an API call, it’s more common to just inform the SPA). Overall, 401 and 403 are expected outcomes in certain cases and are part of normal operation – they enforce that the MCP server is not a loophole; it abides by the same access rules. The implementation should ensure these HTTP statuses are correctly returned and not masked by a generic 200/success with an error message, because proper status codes allow the frontend (and any monitoring tools) to detect an auth issue.

Security Best Practices and Hardening
	•	Enforce HTTPS and Secure Cookies: The entire system must be deployed over HTTPS so that cookies and data aren’t exposed in transit. The auth cookies should always have the Secure flag, ensuring they are only sent over encrypted connections ￼. This prevents man-in-the-middle attackers from sniffing session IDs. Additionally, use the HttpOnly flag on auth cookies so that they cannot be accessed by any JavaScript on the page ￼. Together, Secure and HttpOnly significantly reduce the risk of token theft via network interception or XSS. In short, the session token is never accessible to scripts and never travels in plaintext, making it tough for an attacker to hijack.
	•	Validate JWTs and Use Short Expiry: If JWTs are used, the MCP server should rigorously validate them on each request. This means checking the signature against the known public key of the issuer, verifying the token’s expiration (exp claim), audience, issuer, etc., and rejecting tokens that fail any check. It’s advisable that JWT access tokens are short-lived (e.g. 15 minutes or so) ￼. Short lifetimes limit the damage if a token were somehow stolen. The main system can handle refreshing tokens (e.g. via a refresh token stored in an HttpOnly cookie) – the MCP server’s role is just to accept or deny based on whether the access token is currently valid. By not extending or storing the token, the MCP server naturally obeys the expiration; if the token expires, the next request will be denied and the user will need a new one (which the main auth flow can provide). This aligns with the principle that anyone possessing a JWT can use it until it expires, so expiration should be timely ￼ and the MCP server should never override or ignore the expiry.
	•	Rely on Proven Identity Providers: The MCP server itself should not implement the low-level authentication (e.g., verifying passwords). Instead, it should rely on the existing admin panel’s authentication provider or identity service. Whether that’s an internal auth system or an external IdP (OAuth2/OIDC), leverage it to issue and check tokens. For instance, many setups delegate auth to an OIDC service which issues a JWT access token that the MCP server can trust ￼. This separation means the MCP server’s code stays focused on proxying AI requests and enforcing auth, rather than handling login UI, password storage, etc. It also means any enterprise security features (MFA, SSO, etc.) are automatically inherited from the main login system.
	•	Strict Origin Checking (CORS): Configure the MCP server to only accept requests from the allowed origin (the admin panel’s origin). As discussed, CORS should be locked down – e.g., no wildcard * when credentials are involved ￼. The MCP server can maintain an allowlist of origins (in many cases just one origin). This prevents scripts on other sites from tricking the browser into sending requests. Additionally, the MCP server should ignore any “Origin” headers not in the allowlist to avoid header-spoofing. Some implementations also double-check the Origin or Referer on the server side for sensitive operations, as an extra CSRF defense (though a properly configured CORS with credentials is usually sufficient).
	•	CSRF Protection: If the admin panel uses cookies, conventional CSRF protection measures should be in place. SameSite cookies (Lax or Strict) offer some CSRF mitigation by default, but since we often set SameSite=None for cross-origin, the application should implement CSRF tokens for state-changing requests. The MCP server can coordinate with this by requiring a custom header or token (perhaps provided by the admin frontend) for any non-idempotent actions. However, because the MCP server only accepts requests from the trusted domain and under the context of an authenticated user, the primary CSRF risk is mitigated by the fact that an attacker from another site cannot easily invoke the MCP server (thanks to CORS). Nonetheless, it’s good practice to treat the MCP server’s endpoints with the same CSRF considerations as the main API.
	•	No Privileged Escalation: Ensure the MCP server itself does not run with an overly privileged account when calling backend APIs. It should not have a master API key or admin token that it uses to perform actions. Instead, it must always use the user’s credentials. This avoids any scenario where a bug in the chat logic could perform an admin-only action. The MCP server should also not mix user contexts – each request should use only the cookie/token from that request. There must be no caching of one user’s token and accidentally using it for another. Isolation between sessions on the server is critical (which is naturally achieved by stateless design).
	•	Audit and Logging: From a security standpoint, logging is important. The MCP server should log authentication events (without sensitive data). For instance, log when a request is rejected due to invalid session, or when it forwarded a request to a protected API on behalf of a user. These logs can be audited to ensure that the MCP server is only doing what it’s expected to. If there are abnormal patterns (e.g., repeated 401 errors or attempts to access forbidden resources), those could indicate a misconfiguration or a possible malicious script attempting something. The logs in combination with the main app’s logs help paint a full picture of user actions via the AI assistant.
	•	Defense-in-Depth: Apply standard web security hardening to the MCP server as well. This includes keeping the server and SDK up to date (to patch any vulnerabilities), using content security policy (CSP) on the admin panel pages to restrict where scripts can load from (so no unauthorized script can interfere with the MCP SDK), and rate limiting the MCP server’s endpoints to prevent abuse. Although the MCP server only works for authenticated users, one could imagine a rogue script or user trying to spam it or use it to brute force something; rate limiting ensures it won’t overwhelm backend APIs. Also, consider output encoding in responses (if the MCP server returns any data to the front-end beyond the chat text, ensure it’s properly sanitized to prevent introducing XSS through the chat data).
	•	Testing and Fail-safe: Finally, test the integrated system thoroughly. For example, intentionally expire a user’s session and confirm the MCP server indeed blocks requests. Test that the MCP server cannot be tricked into acting without a session. Also, have fail-safe responses: if for any reason the MCP server cannot verify the user’s identity, it should refuse the request (better to err on the side of security). For instance, if the MCP server ever sees an ambiguous state (like two cookies or a malformed token), it should default to returning a 401/403 rather than proceeding. This way, any failure in the auth validation path results in a safe refusal, rather than a potential privilege bypass. The guiding principle is that the MCP server acts purely as an extension of the logged-in user’s session – if that session is absent or incorrect, the MCP server does nothing on the user’s behalf.

In summary, the MCP Server authentication model is designed to fully inherit the admin panel’s security context without introducing new session management. By embedding the SDK in the authenticated UI, using the browser’s cookie mechanism to carry credentials, and never storing tokens server-side, the system remains simple and robust. It ensures that all actions the AI assistant takes are authorized as the current user, with no backdoors. Proper CORS configuration and cookie settings are employed to allow this integration in a secure manner. When the user’s auth is not present or sufficient, the MCP server defers to standard 401/403 handling, keeping the security semantics consistent with the rest of the application. This approach maximizes security (no extra attack surface from new tokens) and minimizes developer overhead, since authentication is handled by the existing, proven system and the MCP server just reutilizes it in a carefully controlled way
